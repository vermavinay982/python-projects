Human, animal, plants, earth and environment are indirectly connected to each other and necessary for the existence of healthy life here.
However, by any means if our environment gets affected negatively, creates lots of problems and many challenges in living a simple and healthy life. Our environment acts as a natural world for us and provides a protection to us from the natural calamities.
